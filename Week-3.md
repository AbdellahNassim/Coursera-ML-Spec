- Logistic Regression
- Sigmoid Function / Logistic Function
- Decision Boundary
- Logistic Regression Cost Function is not convex
- **Loss** is a measure of the difference of a single example to its target value while the
- **Cost**  is a measure of the losses over the training set
- Gradient Descent for Logistic Regression
- Overfitting : Algorithm has high variance.
- Underfitting: Algorithm doesn't fit data well, has high bias.
- Generalization: Algorithm predict and generalizes well for unseen data
- Address Overfitting
	- Get more training data.
	- See if you can use fewer features => Feature selection.
	- Regularization: Gently reducing the impact of some of the features
	-
