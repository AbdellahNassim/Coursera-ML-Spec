This is the starting week of learning [Coursera ML Spec](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) , we are going to learn about machine learning. 

# Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning

## What is Machine Learning 

- **Machine Learning** is a Field of Study that gives the computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
- **Supervised Learning:** a domain of Machine Learning that focuses on predicting outputs (Y Labels) based on input data (X).
- **Regression:** Predicting a number from infinitely many possible outputs.
- **Classification:** Predict a category from a finite set of possibilities.
- **Unsupervised Learning:**  Finding interesting patterns in the unlabeled data.
## Regression
- x = "input" variable, input feature
- y = "target" variable, "output" variable
- m = number of training examples
- (x, y) : single training example
- y-hat is the prediction of y
- Univariate linear regression: one input variable
- matplotlib plt : scatter, title, ylabel, xlabel, show
