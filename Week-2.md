- Multiple Linear Regression: Linear regression with multiple feature variables
- Vectorization: Performing an operation in parallel on an array of data instead of one value at a time
- Feature Scaling
- Mean Normalization
- Z-Score Normalization
- Learning Curve
- With Feature Scaling we have equal progress for each parameter during gradient descent.
- Feature Engineering: creating new features to improve the model
- Polynomial Regression
